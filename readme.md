Hello Sir/Madame,
The application you have to run with website on http://localhost:8080/home.
I have created back end of the project, unfortunately I was unable to finish front end.
For this moment you can add user to the user database and game to game database.
i have created additional some CRUD methods. There is created relation ManyToMany between 
game and user database, and it is situated in Action database.
This is interesting project and im going to develop it a little more. And add all methods
and nice look for html as training.
